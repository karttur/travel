Hike to the top of Mount Elgon, October 2003. Together with Joakim Ericsson, a visiting student from Uppsala University, I hiked Mount Elgon for 5 days, including climbing to the peak - Wagagai (4321 m. above sea level). The local staff, both the porters and the rangers, were great. But I write this 15 years later, and can not remember their names.
